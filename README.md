### Instructions for running the app
This project was created using the Expo framework, and tested in the ExpoGo app on iOS devices. The app may also be run using ExpoGo on Android devices, or through other simulators/virtual devices, but it has not been tested in those environments and there may be bugs that occur.  

To run the app, clone or download this repository, and navigate to `ProdUSE/ProdUSE` in your terminal. First, run the command `npm install` to install the necessary packages. Then, run `npx expo start` to run the app.  

Download ExpoGo onto your mobile device (no account required) and ensure that the computer running the app and your phone are on the same network. *(Note: we have sometimes had issues with Pitt wi-fi and running the app, it may be more reliable to use your phones hot spot.)* Open the camera app on iPhone or ExpoGo on Android and scan the QR code that appeared in the terminal when you ran the app. The app will open in ExpoGo and you will be able to use it.
